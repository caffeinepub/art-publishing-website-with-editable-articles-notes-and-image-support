  "summary": "Frontend admin-guard UI was updated to show an owner-only sign-in prompt for /admin and a restricted message for non-admin authenticated users. However, the one-time owner bootstrap mechanism (backend methods + frontend “Claim Owner Access” flow) is not present in the provided diff summary.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-15",
      "requirement": "Implement a one-time backend owner bootstrap mechanism: expose a method to check whether an admin exists and a method to claim/initialize the caller as admin only when no admin exists; trap if an admin already exists; ensure caller becomes admin after successful claim.",
      "reason": "No backend changes are shown at all (no modifications to backend/main.mo or any canister methods), so the required bootstrap methods and admin-state logic cannot be verified as implemented.",
      "evidence": [
        "<file-diff>: Modified files list contains only frontend files; no backend/main.mo changes shown."

      "id": "REQ-16",
      "requirement": "When signed in but not an admin: if backend indicates no admin exists yet, show a “Claim Owner Access” action that calls the backend bootstrap method; on success, admin dashboard becomes accessible without page reload.",
      "reason": "RequireAdmin.tsx only shows an \"Access Restricted\" message when authenticated but not admin; it does not query whether an admin exists, does not display a “Claim Owner Access” action, and does not call any bootstrap method.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/auth/RequireAdmin.tsx: Authenticated but not admin branch only renders Access Restricted card; no claim action or admin-exists check."
